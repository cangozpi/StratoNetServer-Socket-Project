Run Project1-can-gözpınar-68965 to start the server. pass the port number as parameter to the main funciton if you want server to run on a different port than the default one(port:9999 is default).

Run Project1-can-gözpınar-68965-client to start a client and connect to the server(server should be run before running client code). Again you can pass the socket port that you want to connect as a parameter to the main() function. Default port is 9999(same as server default port) for client.
